# Matcha

  This project is about creating a dating website. A user will then be able to register, connect, fill his/her profile, search and look into the profile of other users, like them and chat with those that “liked” back.

  See the [Installation.md](https://github.com/WilliamWTC/Matcha/blob/master/Installation.md) to run the project on your computer.

  The version of the project in this repo is slightly edited to my liking.
